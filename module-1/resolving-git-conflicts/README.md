My name is Silvia Mart√≠nez Valero and I am from Madrid. I was recently working at Starbucks as a Coffee Master, but I took a leave of absence to do this bootcamp. I took a basic Python course and experimented on my own with LiveCode, but nothing more. I am a classical philologist specializing in Ancient Near Eastern languages, so I don't have much programming experience. However. I recently discovered that many of the skills that a philologist or linguist has can also be used in programming, providing (perhaps) a new point of view, compared to before, when only people related to fields of science were programming. 

I am here to change my career and to be able to grow and achieve new things. I knew someone who took one of ironhack's bootcamps and I decided to join this adventure too. I expect to lear whatever is necessary to be able to work in data and have a good career. 

After the bootcamp I expect to find a job and start my new path. I have been many years working in hostelry, so I am looking for a change (and, above all, an opportunity) in a company that values its employees and allows me to grow and explore my full potential.
